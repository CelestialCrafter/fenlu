# todo

## high priority

- handle rate limiting (capabilities?)
- actions protocol + impls
- finish adapting scripts (offload to claude)

## medium priority

- import/export pipeline output from/to file/clipboard
- theming + default themes (rose pine, cattppuccin, gruvbox, tokyo night, nord)
- better styling

## low priority

- let scripts attatch their own data into their history entry
- cross platform support (how will scripts work? theyre just shell scripts/python scripts with a shebang/binaries)
- figure out distribution

## maybe priority

- think about switching script protocols from json
- query completions protocol + impls
