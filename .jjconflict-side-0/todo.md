- handle rate limiting (capabilities?)
- actions protocol + impls
- query completions protocol + impls
- finish adapting scripts (offload to claude)
- better styling
- theming + default themes (rose pine, cattppuccin, gruvbox, tokyo night, nord)
- export pipeline output to file/clipboard
- cross platform support (how will scripts work? theyre just shell scripts/python scripts with a shebang/binaries)
- figure out distribution
- think about switching script protocols from json
