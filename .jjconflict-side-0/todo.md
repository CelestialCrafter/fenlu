# todo

## high priority

- actions protocol + impls

## medium priority

- import/export pipeline output from/to file/clipboard
- theming + default themes (rose pine, cattppuccin, gruvbox, tokyo night, nord)
- better styling
- finer grained control over scripts, if a script implements media/generate and media/transform, there's no way to specify which you want

## low priority

- rename scripts to servers
- let scripts attatch their own data into their history entry
- cross platform support
- figure out distribution

## maybe priority

- think about switching script protocols from json
- query completions protocol + impls
